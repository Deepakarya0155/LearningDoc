Q10. How is inheritance in C++  different from Java? 
In C++ and Java, functions can not be overloaded if they differ only in the return type. The return type of functions is not a part of the mangled name which is generated by the compiler for uniquely identifying each function. The No of arguments, Type of arguments & Sequence of arguments are the parameters which are used to generate the unique mangled name for each function. It is on the basis of these unique mangled names that compiler can understand which function to call even if the names are same(overloading). 
In Java, all objects are dynamically allocated on Heap. This is different from C++ where objects can be allocated memory either on Stack or on Heap. In C++, when we allocate object using new(), the object is allocated on Heap, otherwise on Stack if not global or static.

In Java, when we only declare a variable of a class type, only a reference is created (memory is not allocated for the object). To allocate memory to an object, we must use new(). So the object is always allocated memory on the heap.  Read more
