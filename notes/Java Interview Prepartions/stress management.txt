Stress Management.
---------------------

Find the root cause of stress and try to finsh that .


Take the decision and don't look back.

Always try to stay in present. do not worry about the past and future.

Think about the worst-case and then try to fix the situation after this.

Always try to find the positive thing and try to focus on that. Each situation provides you some learning.

Do not compare yourself with others, because you never know what situation he/she faced. always compare yourself with yourselfs yesterday.

Keep yourself busy so you don't have time for negtive thoughts.
